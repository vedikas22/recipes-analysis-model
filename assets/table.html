      <td>Being a  huge fan of America's Test Kitchen  I just had  to try this and I am  sure glad I did. It is really good. Sweet  corn is  just  coming in season here  and I have  chives in my herb garden so I had all the  best ingredients. I did  use a Jalapeno from the  garden instead of the  habanero. I  just made this and I plan to have it with some chicken. I'll  bet you could use some nice peaches to change it up a bit.      Thanks for posting .</td>

      <td>wow red and white sweetness!  DH loved them , I found them a bit two sweet for me but a nice change to serve strawberries.  very easy recipe, but I think 8 ounces of strawvberries is not enough, if I make them again I will double the strawberries and use about half of the cool whip. (I use light cool whip.)  Thanks for posting.</td>

      <td>so good!  i used applesauce in place of the butter/shortening and added extra vanilla instead of lemon juice, and 2 cups of oats just to thicken the batter up a little, and they turned out perfect.  i just wanted something different for lunch snacks and these seem to be a hit!</td>

      <td>These were just so-so.  I agree with another reviewer that they got better overnight.  I was looking for a use of ripe bananas (instead of my usual banana bread) and I thought these would be great.  They are missing something.  The texture is okay, but I think they need some cinnamon or a little brown sugar or molasses, they were just a bit bland.  I think these good be very good with some work on the "seasoning".

      <td>These were wonderful cookies - I'm rating as a 4 instead of a 5, just because I think you need to make sure the batter is a little thicker, or they'll come out a thin and spread more than expected.  I love the flavour, and I did add 1/4 cup of cinnamon chips and the nuts used were walnuts.  I used butter, too, so next time I'll try shortening (or 1/2 and 1/2) and up the oats/flour if needed.  I think once you make these a couple of times and get the consistency down, they'd be the best thing in the cookie jar!  Made for Zaar Stars - thanks, iewe!!!</td>

But what really brought it to 5 stars is the way it supported and elevated the dahl and mushroom dishes I served it with.  A wonderful complement to any Indian dish.  And the leftovers would make a BANGIN' rice pudding...\r\nMade for Looney Spoons ZWT6</td>

      <td>Great Reuben variation!  I liked making the coleslaw/sauerkraut myself.  I added an extra handful of cabbage into the pot because it was cooking down so much it didn't look like enough for two sandwiches.  When I put the sandwiches together I only ended up using about 2/3 of the meat and 1/2 the cheese called for.  I shredded cheese off a block instead of using slices.  Lastly, I just can't give up my usual Reuben sauce (mayo, chili sauce, horseradish) so we subbed that for the mayo/mustard suggested in your recipe.  I think overall using less cheese and meat brought this "lighter" Reuben down even farther!  Made for PRMR Tag Game.</td>

I used thin sliced whole wheat bread that I keep in the freezer because I don't use bread a lot.  Purchased the meat and cheese especially for this sandwich, except I made a mistake and ordered provolone instead of swiss.  I used a dill pickle relish that I already had and put a thin layer on the sandwich.  Next time I will make with the swiss cheese.  gailanng, thanks so much for posting</td>

      <td>This is the only recipe I've ever used for cornbread. I used to make the Marie Callendar's mix, but not ever again once I tried this! It is awesome, so moist and sweet, like cake. I hate dry, crumbly, tasteless cornbread. I always use the square pan option, I haven't tried the muffins. I highly recommend using the albers cornmeal and this recipe!</td>

      <td>This is my favorite corn bread recipe!  I'm so glad to find it here already.  I actually had to dig my cornmeal box out of the recycling after moving years ago and cut this recipe off the side because no stores around me carried Albers and other brands didn't have this sweeter recipe on them.  I always put a touch of oil or shortening in my 10 inch cast iron skillet and heat it smoking hot while I mix this up so that it sizzles and crisps the outside of the bread when I pour it in, then I put it in the oven.  Great recipe for sweet cornbread.</td>

      <td>Good recipe.  Great crumb and taste.  I halved the recipe which made some measurements difficult, but ended up with 1/4 c. coconut oil, 1/4 t. nutmeg and 2 eggs.  I also used almond milk.  DH liked, so will make again.  Might add some brown sugar for richness next time.</td>

      <td>I gave this recipe four stars only because i like my muffins just a bit sweeter.  i think i will try it with a little honey or sugar.  other than that, they are light and airy and most of all i used up some of my fresh zucchini out of my garden.  Yum yum!!  i put half in the frig and half in the freezer and my daughter who doesn't have to be glueten free loves them and the fact they are so low in calories.  she sneaks one out of frig or freezer every time she comes over.  so give it a try, if you like it just a tad sweet, then add a little sweetness of some kind.  i will definitely make this recipe again.  thanks</td>

      <td>This is a great recipe! I have never made salmon patties before, and I am so glad I chose this recipe! I did add a few things, however. I added a shake of dried parsley leaves from one of the big honkin' containers, which probably equated to about 2 Tablespoons. I also added a couple shakes of paprika, for a little bit of spice (maybe about 1 tsp., or a little less). I also added a shake of garlic powder from the same type of honkin' container (probably about 1 tsp. or so). I don't really measure spices for stuff like this.... I dumped most of the salmon juice (eww...salmon juice) out, but I saved about a tablespoon and put it back in the mixture, just for a tad more moistness. I used canola oil to fry, and I rolled the patties in balls a little bigger than golf balls, then pressed them to about 3/4" thick. Cooking time was right-on. My husband really liked them, and I did too. Thanks for the wonderful recipe! :)</td>

      <td>Lovely cookie. Enjoyed by all. Agree with previous reviewer. The walnuts must be chopped very finely. I didn&amp;#039;t have the problem of the egg yolks settling to the bottom, but I think from a texture stand-point more finely chopped walnuts is better.</td>
